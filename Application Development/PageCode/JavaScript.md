title: Code Guidelines for JavaScript
--- 

The following guidelines apply to JavaScript for PageCode.

## General Guidelines 

- Follow the All Language Styling guidelines.

- Use camelCase when naming functions and variables

- Comment all code using JSDoc style.

- Do NOT check in "commented out" code.

- Use standard components rather than calling the SPEAK Core API (to maximize reuse).  For example, use the LoadOnDemandPanel rather than calling InsertRendering.

- Avoid using Speak core directly in applications, try to use appropriate Speak controls.
