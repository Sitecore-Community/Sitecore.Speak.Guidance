# Sitecore.Speak.Guidance #

The SPEAK Guidance Repository provides concise guidelines, conventions, and best practices related to implementing components and applications in SPEAK.  

*The SPEAK Guidance Repository replaces the Sitecore.Speak.Guideline repository.*

This repository describes *what* to do, not *how* to do it.  Please refer to the [Sitecore Doc Site](https://doc.sitecore.net/products/speak) for information regarding how to perform tasks in SPEAK. 

## How to use this repository

We recommend that you read ALL guidance related your primary task, and you may safely ignore guidance that is not related to your work.
