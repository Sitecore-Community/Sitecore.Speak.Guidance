If you encounter issues, please tell us!

Our goal is to make SPEAK perfect.

We want YOU to help us achieve that goal.  

When you see behavior that you consider inappropriate, please follow the following guidelines when reporting the issue:

- Always provide steps to reproduce the issue using a "clean" SPEAK page and standard components.
	+ Do NOT report an issue and describe it in the context of your application.
	+ We will reject all "application specific" issues.
	+ Recreating with a "clean" SPEAK page and components ensures that your application does not contain inappropriate configuration or custom code, and may help you find the source of the problem without waiting for a response from your issue report.
- Please DO create a Sitecore package that reproduces the issue and attach it to your issue report.
