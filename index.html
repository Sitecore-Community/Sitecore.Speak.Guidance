<a id="speak-guidelines" class="anchor" href="#speak-guidelines" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SPEAK Guidelines</h1>

<p>In order to make SPEAK open to internal developers, we needed to define guidelines in order to accept pull-requests.</p>

<p>Those guidelines must be strictly followed by the people who wants to collaborate.</p>

<p>This guideline is a living guideline and is open to suggestions and improvements. You are welcome to raise issues and propose your pull-requests for the SPEAK collaboration guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Acronym</strong></p>

<p>SPEAK is an acronym for Sitecore Process Enable Accelerator Kit.
BCL is an acronym for Business Component Library.</p>

<p><strong>SPEAK typo</strong></p>

<p>When writing about SPEAK, you should always use capital case. On social media, "SPEAKui" is also acceptable to refer to the SPEAK twitter account.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to that rule.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Javascript, the variable will be called Speak (PascalCase) even if it is an acronym because in JavaScript full capital case for a variable or a name-space means a constant (like Math.PI).</li>
<li>When naming our layouts or items in SPEAK, we have also used the PascalCase notation. As we found that SPEAK-layout was an ugly name, we went for Speak-layout. Normally only the SPEAK project and the BCL should have items containing the name SPEAK.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p>This guideline is new and some part of the current implementation is not entirely reflecting what is described below. If it is the case, it would be kind of you to re-format it following the current guidelines.</p>

<p><em>draft mode</em> </p>

<p>Our workflow is loosely based on <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">Github Flow</a>. We actively develop in the <strong>master</strong> branch. This means that all pull requests by contributors need to be developed and submitted on the master branch. If you need to fix an error for a specific version of SPEAK. You can find it as a "tag". If you need a fix for an anterior release, please contact the Sitecore Support. The master branch created a Symphony package for the Sitecore Platform on a nightly basis. This means that anything committed to master could go to the next release of Sitecore.</p>
