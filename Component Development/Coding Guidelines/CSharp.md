---

The following guidelines apply to C# for components.

- Follow the All Language Styling guidelines.

- Use StyleCop with standard Sitecore settings.

- Mark members with `[NotNull]` and `[CanBeNull]`

- Include meaningful Xml comments for all members.

- Never manipulate (add HTML, set attributes etc.) HTML directly in .CS files - that is for the .CSHTML files.
