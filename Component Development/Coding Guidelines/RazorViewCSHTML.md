title: Code Guidelines for Razor Views
---


The following guidelines apply to CSHTML for components.

- Follow the All Language Styling guidelines.
- Follow the [Bootstrap Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide).
- Do not close the void element.  For example, write `<br>` not `<br />`.
- Use pure HTML and use HTML elements as intended, for example, use `<a>` elements for links, not `<div onclick="...>`.
- Use tools such as the [W3C HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/nu/) to verify HTML.
- Use standard Sitecore helper functions, such as `Sitecore().Controls().GetUserControl()`, to reduce complexity in the View file.
- Use a strongly typed model (except in Core 1.1 components).
- Use double quotes for attribute values.
- Only use entity references for characters with special meaning.  For example, do use `&nbsp;` for a non-breaking space character, do use â‚¬, not `&eur;`.
- Strictly keep structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior (scripting) separate and keep interaction between all three to a minimum.
- Put HTML in the .CSHTML file, never in C#.
- Provide alternative access for multimedia.
- Use a new line for every block, list, or table element and indent every such child element.
- Put as much C# code in the CSHTML file as possible.  Only use a separate C# file for very complex controls.
- Always use a strongly typed model (except for Core 1.1 components).
- Avoid having database calls in the Model or Razor view.
- Set HasNestedControls to true when the view supports nested components.
- Prefix the component CSS class with `sc-`.
- Prefix all data attribute names with `data-sc-`.
- Use dash (-) to separate words in attribute names (for example, `data-sc-property-name`)
- Use the `data-sc-component` attribute to identify the component.
