The following guidelines apply to JavaScript for components.

## General guidelines

- Follow the All Language Styling guidelines.
- Avoid exposing the Global object.
    + Do not use the Window object.  
    + Use RequireJS to express dependencies between JavaScript modules.  
- Use regular assignment to assign value to properties.
    + Get and Set work, but are not as readable.  
- Use the $ prefix for jQuery objects.
- Use camelCase when naming functions and variables
- Comment all code using JSDoc style.
- Do NOT check in "commented out" code.
- Verify usage of "this" in event handlers and callback functions.
- Use Speak handler to reference assets rather than direct URLs.


## Component-Specific Guidelines

- The model should expose all appropriate parameters.
- Declare all public properties in the model's `initialize()` method.
- Since manipulating the DOM is slow, always separate DOM manipulation code from other code and ensure that you manipulate the DOM only once.
- Create helper functions for manipulating the DOM.
- Use properties when data binding can express a change, and/or to express values in the components parameters item.
- Use events when unable to use data binding or require more complex processing than data binding supports.
- Code must pass JSHint validation using the following configuration:

```
    {  
        curly: true,
        eqeqeq: true,
        immed: false,
        latedef: true,
        quotmark: "double",
        noarg: true,
        forin: true,
        newcap: true,
        sub: true,
        undef: false,
        boss: true,
        strict: false,
        unused: false,
        eqnull: true,
        node: true,
        browser: true,
        expr: "warn"
      }
```

- Only reference components from PageCode or other components.
  + Use an event emitter to communicate between a component and a custom module.
