title: Code Guidelines for JavaScript (Core 1.1 only)
---



The following guidelines apply to JavaScript for components that use  the 1.1 version of the SPEAK Core.

## General Guidelines

- Follow the All Language Styling guidelines.
- Follow the standard JavaScript guidelines except when they conflict with the guidelines below.

## Component-Specific Guidelines

- Configure the component to inherit from the proper base component.
- Always use `get`and `set` methods, as direct assignment will break binding.
  + Download the [SPEAK Events module](https://gist.github.com/dervalp/144ca3f5489b0d0d827a)
  + Require it, and extend it:

        define(["/path/to/speakevent.js", "underscore"], function (events, _)  {  
         var API = {}  
          _.extend(API, events);  
          return API;  
        });  


- Use the following code to trigger an event: `API.trigger("events");`
  + The implementations is a modified version of Backbone.js. [Read more about the API here](http://backbonejs.org/#Events)
